  **Acheivements**: 
  
  <br>
 
  - In the early days of career, I worked on some projects like tokens, Nft minting sites, staking platform and crypto dashboard on fiver. And I mantained the five start rating during this timespan. Unfortunately account is not active now.
  
  <br>
  
  - During 2021, I worked together with [Atompad](https://www.atompad.io/) to launch a multichain launchpad. During this time, I developed several smart contracts that held hundreds of thousands of dollars, including one that held $1.8 million earlier this year.
  
  <br>
  
  - In the first half of 2022, I joined [Mtvswap](https://www.mtvswap.finance/pools) to create Decentralized Exchange(DEX) with farms, pools and launchpad that I successfuly did with the talented team. As a result, I gained a lot of knowledge about Defi and Defi programming.
